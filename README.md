# n8sprite-converter
Previously used for converting image files (jpeg, png, etc) to a usable format in my c# game engine, n8engine (https://github.com/N-8-D-e-v/n8engine). Now archived because image files can just be used directly in-engine.

Uses AnotherFileBrowser (https://github.com/SrejonKhan/AnotherFileBrowser) for importing and exporting files.

Obviously I'm not using this anymore but if you really want to do something with it, go ahead; it's under the MIT license as well.
